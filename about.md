The flow of energy through groups and its effect on the success or failure of enterprises is at the heart of my professional interest. My desire to never stand still intellectually has led me to apply my passion to sense, understand, explain, and support changing the dynamics in organizations in different contexts. Examples include the military, a large US soft drink manufacturer in China, an innovative online music startup, international adjudication as well as arbitration between the United States and Iran. The same passion also guided me through a successful career working with decision makers from five different continents at some of the world's premier and politically charged international organizations. Transformation is one of the central themes of my life and ultimately led me to transform my own professional path. Today I am fully dedicated to support individual and business transformation.

I firmly believe that the fundamental challenges organizations are facing today cannot be fixed by just making adjustments to the existing system, but only by holistically transforming the system itself. For such a transformation to be credible and effective,  a change in consciousness and thinking of key decision makers is required. In order to effectively facilitate transformational processes, I closely engage with decision makers one-on-one to get a complete overview of their goals and underlying values. Together, we then seek to map a new path that can be backed by the trust of the relevant stakeholders and instill or renew institutional loyalty. My style is always very people-oriented, direct, pragmatic, and to the point - even more so when addressing those factors impacting operational success that are not easily quantified.

In short, it is my ultimate goal to effectively support my clients to re-evaluate the relevant yardsticks against which to measure performance, drive innovation, catalyze transformational processes and to maximize value creation accordingly.
